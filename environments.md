We are working to catalyze a new era of research that enables interdisciplinary approaches to data-intensive discovery. 

Changes in academia are required to more fully support data scientists who enable new data-driven discoveries. We aim to create new types of institutional environments in which these discoveries can take place.

Many other institutions have an interest in promoting and facilitating data-driven discovery in academia. Below is a list of those that align closely with the objectives of the Data Science Environment Partnership. 

Note: Although certificate and undergraduate or masterâ€™s degree programs in data science are a critical component of academic data science, we focus here on programs that emphasize the use of data-driven approaches to active research. For international data science educational programs, see this curated list: [github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges).
