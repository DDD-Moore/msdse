We are working to catalyze a new era of research that enables interdisciplinary approaches to data-intensive discovery. 

Changes in academia are required to more fully support data scientists who enable new data-driven discoveries. We aim to create new types of institutional environments in which these discoveries can take place.

## The Data Science Cooperative

One approach we are now supporting, together with the [Academic Data Science Alliance](http://www.academicdatascience.org/), is the creation of a Data Science Cooperative for early-mid career researchers who use data intensive tools and methodologies. Born out of the MSDSE Alumni, this group is mobilizing their collective knowledge and culture to provide a grassroots Data Science Environment. 

The mission of the Data Science Cooperative is to equip a trusted and growing community of academically-minded data scientists to share expertise in ways that benefit the individual members and the cooperative. Their peer-powered culture, software-enabled communications systems, convening capacity, and common voice will help members find collaborators, audiences, answers, and financial support. And their cooperative projects will gather and cultivate collective knowledge assets for the shared benefit of membership and audiences. They will pursue their mission in a way that aligns with academic values like transparency, inclusion, and knowledge sharing.    

The 2019 Call for Nominations for the Co-Op Leadership Committee is currently underway. See the [FAQ's](/files/2019CoopNoms) for more information.

## <a name="others"></a>Other Data Science Centers

Many other institutions have an interest in promoting and facilitating data-driven discovery in academia. Below is a partial list (compiled a few years ago) of those that align closely with the objectives of the Data Science Environment Partnership. 

Note: Although certificate and undergraduate or masterâ€™s degree programs in data science are a critical component of academic data science, we focus here on programs that emphasize the use of data-driven approaches to active research. For international data science educational programs, see this curated list: [github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges).
