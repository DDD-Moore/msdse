At the intersection of natural science, computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics is data science. Although data-driven research is already accelerating scientific discovery, substantial systemic challenges in academic research need to be overcome to maximize its impact and create supportive environments for researchers using develop data-intensive practices. 

We seek to enhance data-driven discovery by supporting cross-disciplinary academic data scientists at research institutions. Our work is organized around six challenges, which are themes used to effectively focus our efforts to advance the future of academic data science. **[Learn more](/themes):**

- [Careers](/themes/#careers)
- [Education and training](/themes/#education)
- [Tools and software](/themes/#tools)
- [Reproducibility and open science](/themes/#reproducibility)
- [Physical and intellectual space](/themes/#space) 
- [Ethnography and evaluation](themes/#ethnography)

We have created three **Data Science Environments** to work toward our goal: 

- [UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science](/ucb)
- [NYU Center for Data Science](/nyu)
- [UW eScience Institute](/uw)

Other institutions are working toward similar goals. [Read more about other data science initiatives](/environments#others).
