NEWS: The 2019 MSDSE Summit and the 2019 Data Science Leadership Summit are in full organizational swing! We look forward to these two great events every Fall. This year the summits are in the first week of November. Check out the websites for more information:

Although data-driven research is already accelerating scientific discovery, substantial systemic challenges in academia need to be overcome to maximize its impact and create supportive environments for researchers using and developing data-intensive practices. 

We seek to enhance data-driven discovery by supporting cross-disciplinary academic data scientists at research institutions. Our work is organized around six challenges, which are themes used to effectively focus our efforts to advance the future of academic data science. **[Learn more](/themes):**

- [Careers](/themes/#careers)
- [Education and training](/themes/#education)
- [Tools and software](/themes/#tools)
- [Reproducibility and open science](/themes/#reproducibility)
- [Physical and intellectual space](/themes/#space) 
- [Data Science studies](themes/#ethnography)

We have created three **Data Science Environments** to work toward our goal: 

- [UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science](/ucb)
- [NYU Center for Data Science](/nyu)
- [UW eScience Institute](/uw)

Here's our joint white paper detailing our approaches and some of our lessons learned: [Creating Institutional Change in Data Science](/creating_institutional_change.html). 
For our other white papers and reports, [check out our Reports page](/reports).

Other institutions are working toward similar goals. [Read more about other data science initiatives](/environments#others).
