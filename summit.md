### More info on posters & demos

Both posters and demos will be available during the "Lightning talks & posters/demos" sessions. The format of these sessions is a 5 minute lightning talk, followed by 15 minutes of unstructured time for attendees to view posters and demos. 

**Posters:** suggested size is 30" tall by 40" wide. There will be easels with foam backing boards for displaying posters in the hall. 

**Demos:** There will be tall tables set up close to outlets. You are responsible for providing the computer/other equipment needed. Tables will be located around the perimeter of the room.
