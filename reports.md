# <a name="change"></a> Creating Institutional Change in Data Science

How do we create and sustain long-term institutional structures which support the new generation of scientists whose research depends crucially on the analysis of massive, noisy, and/or complex data and whose work may require substantial curation and/or development efforts? What about those scientists who focus entirely on building next-generation tools that others ultimately use to derive new science?

# <a name="eval"></a> 2015 - 2018 MSDSE Evaluation

In 2015, the Sloan and Moore Foundations contracted with [Abt Associates](https://www.abtassociates.com/) to conduct a 3-year evaluation of the MSDSE program, which concluded in Fall 2018. The study drew on several sources: review of MSDSE reports, websites, and policy papers; three site visits to each university; 132 interviews and two on-line surveys of participants and non-participants; and observations at three all hands summits. In addition, Abt Associates examined the broader data science landscape by interviewing the leaders of 17 entities similar to MSDSEs about their efforts.
