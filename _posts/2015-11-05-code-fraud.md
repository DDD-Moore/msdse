_This exerpt is taken from a [November 5th post by Laura Nor&eacute;n on the Berkeley Institute for Data Science blog](http://bids.berkeley.edu/news/information-escrows-combat-code-fraud)._

Code fraud is the implementation of software that induces illegal, unethical, or otherwise malicious outcomes. Laura Nor&eacute;n, postdoctoral Associate at NYU's [Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/), writes about code fraud, code review, risks around whistleblowing, and lowering the barrier for reporting code fraud. No need for potential whistleblowers to act like scared woodland creatures!
