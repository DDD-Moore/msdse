The [Data Science Studies (DSS) group](/themes/#ethnography) at New York University, UC Berkeley, and Univeristy of Washington, part of the Moore and Sloan Data Science Environment (MSDSE), together with collaborators from The Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, & Society (CSTMS) at UC Berkeley, are organizing a thematic track on [Critical Data Studies](http://www.nomadit.co.uk/easst/easst_4s2016/panels.php5?PanelID=4041) for the 4s/EASST Conference BCN-2106 Science + Technology by Other Means: Exploring Collectives, Spaces, and Futures in Barcelona, August 31 – September 3, 2016.

They are inviting papers investigating data-driven techniques in academic research and analytic industries and the consequences of implementing data­-driven products and processes. Papers utilizing computational methods or ethnography with theorization of technology, social power, or politics are encouraged.
